This model is example  of how mutiple regression  work. 
At this example I used the random data set which is itself generate by code using the numpy.
This has four variables they are R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend and Profit.
During model examine I consider the first three variables are independent variables and last one is dependent variables.

Finals result R_Squared valule is 0.9906 which means our model is 99% accurate to the predicted value vs actual value.
